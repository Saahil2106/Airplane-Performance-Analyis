Introduction:
The aviation industry has transformed since the invention of airplanes in 1903, becoming a key component of global economies and transportation. Initially exclusive to the wealthy, air travel became accessible to the public after World War II, thanks to innovations in civil aviation. In the U.S., the air network includes over 5,000 public airports, with major hubs like Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta, Los Angeles International, and John F. Kennedy International serving millions annually. American Airlines, Delta, and United are the largest carriers, controlling much of the market. In 2013, U.S. air travel saw significant growth, carrying 743 million passengers, driven by improved economic conditions, expanded international routes, and advancements like mobile check-ins. The industry also saw a $12 billion profit, aided by fees and add-ons, with the American Airlines-US Airways merger further shaping the market.
